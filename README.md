<h2>Andoiii's Tinier Projects üê≤</h2>
<p>A collection of one-off thingys that aren't big enough to realllyy have its own repository. In other words, these did not take 3 months of continous effort or anything ahahaha</p>
<h3>Projects Lists</h3>
<list>
<li>Antiquated Quadratic Calculator</li>
<li>Antiquated Connect 4</li>
<li>Single Trig Expression Reducer</li>

<h3>Antiquated Quadratic Calculator</h3>
<p>Created back in 2021 when I started to first go into coding, this is a VERY rough quadratic calculator. It looks like it comes straight out of 2004, 
and could definetly need some help when it comes to user experience, but it works and gets the job done (when applicable)</p>
<h4>Functionality</h4>
<list>
<li>Applies the Quadratic Formula (duh)</li>
<li>Graphical Interface</li>
<li>Can handle complex roots (Displays i)</li>
<li>Can handle square roots (Displays ‚àö)</li>
</list>

<h4>Anti-Functionality</h4>
<list>
<li>Integer Inputs only</li>
<li>Does not simplify answer</li>
<li>Is a Fraction Puritan</li>
</list>

<h4>Things Used</h4>
<list>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Tkinter Module</li>

<h3>Antiquated Connect 4</h3>
<p>Ever wanted a Connect 4 that you can play in the terminal? Well, this exists. Written in 2021 by a younger Andoiii.</p>

<h4>Functionality</h4>
<list>
  <li>It's Connect 4.</li>
  <li>Row Numbers so you can tell which column is which</li>
  </list>
<h4>Anti-Functionality</h4>
<list>
  <li>Only has 2 Player Mode</li>
  <li>Uses X and Y to mark Pieces</li></list>
<h4>Things Used</h4>
<list><li>Python</li></list>

<h3>Single Trigonometric Expression Reducer</h3>
<p>Given an expression like sin 4Œ∏, whats an equivalent equation expressed in only sin Œ∏ and cos Œ∏ terms? This should help.</p>
<p>This is a technically a story on how Complex Numbers are Super good for this specific problem, thanks DeMoivres</p>
<p>WORK IN PROGRESS</p>

<h4>Functionality</h4>
<list>
  <li>Can take negative input like sin -4Œ∏</li>
  <li>Uses Memoization for Recursive Solving</li>
  <li>Takes 11 seconds to compute what sin 1000x is</li>
  <li>Basic Trig Algebra System</li>
</list>
<h4>Anti-Functionality</h4>
<list>
  <li>Glorified Pascal's Triangle Calculator</li>
  <li>Does not know what the Pythagorean Identity is</li>
  <li>Why would you use this</li>
</list>
<h4>Things Used</h4>
<list><li>Racket</li></list>
